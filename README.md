# Rightclick Backup
A simple Windows utility that creates backup copies through the right-click context menu.

## Setup

See [releases](https://github.com/alexmajewski/rightclick-backup/releases) page for the setup file.

## How to use

The goal of this program is to keep things simple. 

One click = one organized and numbered copy in a backup folder right next to the original file.

## Settings

Launch the program (you can find it in the Start menu) in order to access simple settings:

1. Creating additional subfolders in the 'backup' folder for each file.

2. Adding a file cap which removes older copies beyond a specified limit.
